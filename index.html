    <h4>so you might know the notorious wh4le exploit, which was fake? well there is some truth to it, and that is the debug windows feature on chromeos. google have tried everything  in their power to prevent you from knowing the debug windows feature,  but they didnt do anything on chromebooks so it can't be accessed; they simply disabled it on chromebooks, but recently they have added extra security and steps to prevent students from accidentally stumbling across the debug windows, and this exploit shows you how to enable and access debug windows, which can be made from chrome apps or via a browser from a popup, which is what makes this possible. you can now start the exploit.</h4>
